# Estimating Energy Consumption of Homes
#### Soumika Seelam
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a **linear regression model** that predicts a home's **monthly energy consumption (kWh)** based on various household and environmental factors. By analyzing data on home characteristics and weather conditions, we can estimate energy usage and help homeowners optimize their electricity consumption.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Energy consumption varies based on multiple factors, including home size, number of residents, appliances, insulation, and weather conditions. Our goal is to create a model that accurately predicts monthly energy consumption using these features, helping homeowners and policymakers make data-driven decisions about energy efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 📊 Collect or generate a dataset containing energy consumption data.
- 🛠️ Preprocess and analyze the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- 🏗️ Build a **linear regression model** to predict energy consumption.
- ✅ Evaluate the model using performance metrics like **R² score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
- 🔍 Interpret the model results and identify the most influential factors in energy consumption.

## 📌 Features & Target Variable

### 🔹 Input Features (X):
- 🏠 **Home size** (sq ft)
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Number of residents**
- ⚡ **Number of appliances**
- 🏗️ **Insulation rating** (1-10 scale)
- 🌡️ **Average monthly temperature** (°C or °F)

### 🎯 Target Variable (y):
- ⚡ **Energy consumption (kWh/month)**

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection** 📥: Obtain real-world or synthetic energy usage data.
2. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊: Visualize trends and check correlations between features.
4. **Model Building** 🤖: Train a **linear regression model** to predict energy consumption.
5. **Model Evaluation** 📈: Assess performance using **R² score** and **MAE**.
6. **Optimization & Interpretation** 🔬: Improve model accuracy and analyze feature importance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- 🐍 **Python** (for data processing and modeling)
- 📊 **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- 📉 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- 🔍 **Scikit-learn** (for regression modeling)

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
- ✅ A **trained linear regression model** capable of predicting energy consumption.
- 🔍 Insights into how different factors impact energy usage.
- 📑 A report summarizing the findings and potential areas for improvement.
